// Test Summary: Employee Endpoint Issues Fixed

console.log("‚úÖ IDENTIFIED ISSUES:");
console.log("1. Route Issue: /dashboard/employees route was missing");
console.log("2. Access Context Issue: Role-based filtering was too restrictive");
console.log("3. Logging Issue: Insufficient debugging information");

console.log("\n‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:");

console.log("\n1. Added /dashboard/employees route in dashboard.routes.ts");
console.log("   - Route: GET /api/dashboard/employees");
console.log("   - Middleware: permissionMiddleware.requireAnyPermission(['employee.read', 'profile.read'])");
console.log("   - Handler: Proxies to employeeController.getEmployees()");

console.log("\n2. Enhanced Employee Controller logging:");
console.log("   - Added detailed request logging in getEmployees()");
console.log("   - Added access context creation logging");
console.log("   - Added search result logging");
console.log("   - Added error logging");

console.log("\n3. Enhanced Access Context creation:");
console.log("   - Added role-based permission logging");
console.log("   - Improved permission assignment for all roles");
console.log("   - Added ownership check logging");

console.log("\n4. Enhanced Employee Service logging:");
console.log("   - Added raw employee count logging");
console.log("   - Added role-based filtering logging");
console.log("   - Added per-employee filtering details");

console.log("\n5. Enhanced Role-based filtering:");
console.log("   - Added detailed permission checking logs");
console.log("   - Added access level identification");
console.log("   - Maintained security while improving visibility");

console.log("\nüîß USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:");
console.log("1. Access employees via: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/employees");
console.log("2. This now routes to: http://localhost:5004/api/dashboard/employees");
console.log("3. Which proxies to: /api/employees with proper access control");

console.log("\nüìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:");
console.log("- super-admin: Should see all employees with full data");
console.log("- hr-admin: Should see all employees with full data");  
console.log("- manager: Should see team employees with salary (if permission)");
console.log("- hr-staff: Should see employees without salary");
console.log("- employee: Should see limited public information");

console.log("\nüêõ DEBUGGING:");
console.log("- Check backend console for detailed logs starting with:");
console.log("  üîç [EmployeeController] getEmployees called by user");
console.log("  üìã [EmployeeController] Filters applied");
console.log("  üîê [EmployeeController] Access context created");
console.log("  ‚úÖ [EmployeeController] Search result");

console.log("\n‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT STEPS:");
console.log("1. Restart the backend server");
console.log("2. Test access with different user roles");
console.log("3. Check backend logs for detailed debugging information");
console.log("4. Verify employees are returned for higher roles");
